You open your eyes, and you are greeted by an unfamiliar ceiling.
Startled, you get to your feet and quickly scan your surroundings. It's
dark except for the stream of light coming from a crack on the only boarded
window in the room. You try to peek through the crack, but you cannot see
anything. You wonder where you are and who could have possibly brought you here.

<------------------------------------------------>
look
The room is a picture of decay with only a faded number identifying it as room-4. The bed you were
 lying on is stained with what looks like dried blood. Could it be your blood? No - it is not. The
 only way out of the room aside from the door to the corridor is a window that is boarded shut. It
 looks like it has been like that for decades. There is a door going west from here. You see a candle
 on the floor. You see a match on the floor.

The candle is now lit. It illuminates everything in the room.
walk west
The corridor is lit with the candle. It is so long that you cannot see to the end. You notice that
 there are words written on the wall. There is a door going east from here. There is a way going north
 from here. There is a door going south from here.
read wall
I do not know that command.
study wall
The following words are scratched onto the wall - get out of here! Be careful! Do not die! Do not go
 to the basement. Please survive!
walk north
It feels eerie here. The air turns frigid. You feel as if someone is behind you. You turn around but
 there is no one there. The large looming door to the north can be opened with a key. There is a way
 going south from here. There is a door going east from here.
walk east
You feel the urge to vomit. The sight of a corpse strapped to a hospital bed welcomes you. It is
 skeletal yet well preserved. It seems to have been strapped there for so long its skin has grown over
 the restraints. There is a door going west from here. You see a key on the floor. You see a rod on
 the floor. You see a note2 on the floor.

 there are words written on the wall. There is a door going east from here. There is a way going north
 from here. There is a door going south from here.
walk south
This room could easily be mistaken for a bathroom. It certainly smells like you just halved you life.
 it looks like it was once a laboratory. There are tubes and beakers of all shapes and sizes. The jars
 lining the walls seem to contain... Human organs. There is a welding machine in the corner. There is
 a door going north from here. There is a stair going downstairs from here. You see a scalpel on the
 floor. You see a note1 on the floor.

You have unlocked the door to room-2.

It looks like this room was used for storage. There is nothing much inside aside from the various
 hospital equipment pushed against the walls. There is a figure before you. Looking closer you observe
 that it is a girl with long hair wearing a ragged hospital gown. She has her back turned towards you
 so you cannot see her face. You call out to her but she does not respond. There is a door going east
 from here.
poke girl
She slowly turns around. Where her face should be is a gaping hole lined with shark-like teeth.
 perhaps you should not have poked her. She lunges at you and takes a bite of your arm. You can still
 run away but who knows how long you will survive. Perhaps you can defend yourself. Or leave now while
 you still can.
poke girl
So you poked her again. This time she goes for your head. You have been decapitated. Sorry you lose!
